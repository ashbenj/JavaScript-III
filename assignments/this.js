/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words, explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Implicit Binding points to the object on which the function is called or what's to the lect of the period when the function is called.
* 2. Explicit Binding tells the JavaScript engine to set "this" to point to a certain value using call, apply, or bind.
* 3. New Binding uses the "new" keyword, constructs a new object, and "this" points to it.
* 4. Window/Global Object Binding is when the value of "this" is in the window/console object.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
